# MONITOR_BINANCE_LIQUIDATIONS
Real-time monitoring of futures liquidations on the Binance exchange.
Requirements: WINDOWS 10
INSTRUCTION:
⚫ Use a FILTER to monitor the coins you need. Input currency pairs from one or more into the filter. To monitor several coins, in the filter field input them one by one with a comma separator.
FOR EXAMPLE: BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT,CfxUSdt
You can enter both uppercase and lowercase letters.
⚫ The data is saved to a file (binance_liqquidation.csv) located in the same folder as the program. All currency pairs are written to the file. Using a filter does not affect writing to a file.
⚫ Input the amount of liquidations in dollars in the filter under the "F.A.Q" button. If the "all" value in the liquidation line exceeds the entered value, the liquidation line will be highlighted in a different color.
